Most Pictures are of the aspect ratio of: 500px x 325px (or simply 20x13)

Exception: the pictures on the about us page. 
Just make sure that they are all uniform in aspect ratio in every row
because all cards in a row will resize to be the same hieght.

An online resizer (i.e. picresize.com) can resize to custom aspect ratios, 
but be careful your image doesn't stretch.

Microsoft Word is great for creating transparent backgrounds.
